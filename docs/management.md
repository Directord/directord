# Management

* TOC
{:toc}

The **User** CLI provides for cluster management and insight into operations.
These functions allow operators to see and manipulate job and node status within
the cluster.

## UI

The server component of directord provides for a minimal read-only UI which
provides insight into job executions and nodes within the cluster. To start
the UI component use the `--run-ui` flag when starting the server.
