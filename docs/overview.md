# Director Components

* TOC
{:toc}

Director is a single application which consists of three parts:

* **Server** - The server is the centralized manager of all communication and
  application delivery.

* **Client** - The client is the minimal application required for enrolling a
  node into a given cluster.

* **User** - CLI utility which interfaces with the server over a local socket
  connect.

Director allows for the user to configure the application using environment
variables, a configurations file, or command line switches.

> NOTE: Because the user interface communicates with the server over a UNIX
  socket, the User and Server components are assumed to exist on the same
  machine.

### Cluster Messaging

The cluster messaging uses a router format which ensures it has bi-directional
communication to and from the nodes. The router allows us to create a low
latency mesh which monitors node health and ensures is highly responsive
instruction delivery network.
