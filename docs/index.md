# Welcome to Directord

Directord is a powerful automation platform and protocol built to drive
infrastructure and applications across the physical, edge, IoT, and cloud
boundaries; efficient, pseudo-real-time, at scale, made simple.

Directord was created to solve several deployment-specific problems unique to
large-scale heterogeneous environments; however, this power doesn't require
elaborate operations teams or huge hardware commitments. Directord has been
built to be efficient at any scale. The application flexibility created by
Directord allows operators to scale as needed using a simple, fast, stable, and
unique deployment engine with an easy-to-understand DSL. From one node to
thousands, Directord has it covered.

> Direct your deployment instead of being driven insane by elements,
  ingredients, and attestations.

## First Principles

* Directord uses well defined interfaces with clear documentation and
  boundaries.

* Directord implements a fingerprinting system which ensures a deployment is
  predictable, reproducible, and idempotent at any level.

* Directord is platform agnostic and depends on well defined libraries which
  are generally available on most operating systems.

* Directord is an easily debuggable framework with coherent logging and the
  ability to expose exact job definitions, target operations, and runtime
  statistics.

* Directord is stateless and natively runs within a container management
  ecosystem or within a traditional operating system.

* Directord is light, and has been designed to use a few resources as possible,
  optimizing for consistency, stability, and performance; this means Directord can
  be co-located within a cluster's deliverables or external to the environment.
